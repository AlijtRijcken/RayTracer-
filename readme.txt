Falco Vos (6513107) en Alijt Rijcken (6132081)

- Distibution work: Alijt wrote most of the code (main part of MyApplication.cs, Ray, Sphere, Light Class)
		    Falco helped with the TransX() and TransY Methods. 
		    We tried to make the Line intersect with lines, but didn't manage. The Line Class is still in the project, but no Line : IPrimitives where added. 

- Performance: For loops in the MyApplication.cs are parallelize. 
- TransX() and TransY() decouple screen resolution from world size.
